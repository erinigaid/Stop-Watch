# Stop-Watch

## A system that controls a stop-watch and displays it on 7-segements

### Drivers: GPIO, Timer (CTC), External Interrupts, 7-segment, MC: ATmega32

The time is stored as array members (seconds, minutes, hours).

Macros was used to avoid using magic numbers as much as possible.

Timer1 ISR only sets the global variable g_TimerFlag, so it would be short and deterministic. 

Prescaler choice was 1024 to lower the compare match value as much as possible.

Delay is 10 microsec so the user wouldnâ€™t notice the the any of the 7-segments is off.
